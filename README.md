# MovieCleaner
Removes media files where there already is a higher resolution ([RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/movie_cleaner))

## Prerequisites

* ruby
* A movie library with sub-folders per movie containing different quality files of the movie

## Installation

    $ gem install movie_cleaner

## Usage

```
$ movie_cleaner [options]
```

| option | description | example |
|-|-| - |
|`-v`| verbose - omitting this results in a completely `\| bash`-able output of `rm` commands. | |
|`-d,--directory DIRECTORY`| Directory which contains all other movie folders | `-d /home/user/media/movies` |
|`-r,--resolutions res1,res2`| Comma-separated list of resolutions in order of priority | `-r 1080p,720p` |
